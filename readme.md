![](https://media.giphy.com/media/TLKKExVa9v8bu/giphy.gif)

#### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges - it's up to you to use what you've learned to come up with a fun and interesting game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to create a project presentation that you will use to present your work at the end of project week. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking and presenting about your code.

Show us what you've got!

#### Programming Requirements

Your app must:

- Your game should have two views: a landing view and a game view
- Deploy your game online to GitHub pages
- Include at least one CSS transition fired by a DOM event
- Create a landing page that includes a form
- Use your form to collect information about the user and display that information on the game page; be sure to add things to your form, if needed, like buttons, sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
- Style your form, landing page, and game page with class-based CSS. No inline styles.
- Include a media query for a tablet to make your pages responsive
- Use either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation

##### Programming Constraints :no_entry_sign::

- Collision detection games are NOT allowed

  ***Note:***
  >If you are set on doing a collision game, you may petition to do one. This petition involves either a working collision example that you have previously made OR an **in depth**, **technical** written statement explaining the collision logic you plan on implementing.

- HTML Canvas based games are NOT allowed

---

#### Presentation Requirements 

- **Create and get approval for a wireframe for your game page**
- Comment your code appropriately

Your presentation must:

- Be at least 3 slides
- Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much "insider" terminology
- Include at least one wireframe that shows your game page
- Include a screenshot of the existing landing page you've replicated
- Answer the following questions:
	- What features did you include?
	- Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
	- Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?

***Note***
If you're creating a two (or more)-player game, you MUST:

- allow players to take turns
- design logic for winning & visually display which player has won


**Bonus**

- If this is a one-player game, design logic for winning & visually display which player won (why? not all games have one winner)
- Include at least one animation using HTML Canvas or SVG 
- Include a "Tutorial Section" of this landing page (why: instructions help think through the "UX" of your project)

#### Necessary Deliverables

For the app:
* A working game, built by you, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Bitballon](https://www.bitballoon.com)
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, wireframes the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

For the presentation:

* Create a presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 3 slides that answer the questions above and images of your wireframes and a screenshot of your landing page.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
